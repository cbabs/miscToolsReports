To get the required libs use the following command:
pip install xlsxwriter

Once that is installed, here is an example of how to use the program.  
Open powershell or a terminal window.  Go to the directory where the file is.  
Then run the command to have python execute the py file and make sure the
hosts.txt is present.  I have python installed in c:\python36\ so for me it would look

c:\test>c:\python36\python.exe dnsResolver.py
